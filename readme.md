Friend Manager is an app for managing friends similar to that of a CRM. It provides the ability to store and organize friends, acquaintences, and members other social groups the user may belong to by a variety of filters in order to for the user to better understand their friends. In addition, Friend Manager also bridges the gap between a hectic life schedule and the balancing of relationships by generating automatic messages to friends at user determined intervals. It also has information on how long it has been since the user and a particular contact have seen each other as well as where the users friends are physically located.
